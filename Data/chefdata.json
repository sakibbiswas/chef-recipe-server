      "details": "Panta Ilish is a traditional food that almost every Bangladeshi eats at the Pohela Boishakh Festival (the first day of Bangla year). It’s the most popular food in Bangladesh. We love this dish as it is a great symbol and celebration of our culture and tradition.It’s a platter of leftover rice soaked in water and served with fried hilsa, achar, and dal. People eat Panta Ilish in the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. The flavorful, crispy, and delicious hilsa fish served with water-soaked cold rice and spicy bharta presents a combination of salty and chili tastes.",
            "Biodata":"A personal chef’s job is not just to cook food for their clients. They have to start by learning about their clients’ eating habits, preferences, and any dietary restrictions/allergies. A personal chef can offer clients ideas by showing them their personal menu cards. Once the meals are decided, clients can decide on the days and timings they would like to have their meals prepared. Depending on a client’s situation, a personal chef will also be able to help them to obtain the right ingredients. In ancient times, royals and aristocrats hired a team of chefs."

      "details": "Almost every restaurant in Bangladesh serves this dish, and more than 50,000 grilled chickens are sold every day throughout the country. There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations of spices that are used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat. It’s a very successful strategy.Now, it is mostly eaten with Naan Roti. Naan Roti is an oven-baked leavened flatbread—the perfect food with chicken. The bread is a little sweet while the chicken is spicy. This combination creates a fabulous wild taste in your mouth.",

      "details": "Haleem is an Arabic dish. It is a popular stew made with meat—usually beef or mutton—lentils, barley, and spices. It is sold on street stalls and in bazaars (markets) as a snack, and making haleem involves a lengthy and complex process. It can be served with mint, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, ginger root, and green chilies.Haleem is a high-calorie dish, providing protein from the meat and fiber and carbohydrates from the combinations of grains and pulses. This is quite possibly why the dish is so popular for breaking fast during Ramadan.",
            "Biodata":"A personal chef’s job is not just to cook food for their clients. They have to start by learning about their clients’ eating habits, preferences, and any dietary restrictions/allergies. A personal chef can offer clients ideas by showing them their personal menu cards. Once the meals are decided, clients can decide on the days and timings they would like to have their meals prepared. Depending on a client’s situation, a personal chef will also be able to help them to obtain the right ingredients. In ancient times, royals and aristocrats hired a team of chefs."

It is traditionally eaten after lunch as the people of Bangladesh love to eat sweet dishes after a heavy meal. Sweet and spongy rasgulla is also served to guests and at festivals and special occasions.Its origins are contested. Some believe Rasgulla originated in East India while others claim is was Bangladesh. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena and semolina, cooked in a light syrup.

            "Biodata":"A personal chef’s job is not just to cook food for their clients. They have to start by learning about their clients’ eating habits, preferences, and any dietary restrictions/allergies. A personal chef can offer clients ideas by showing them their personal menu cards. Once the meals are decided, clients can decide on the days and timings they would like to have their meals prepared. Depending on a client’s situation, a personal chef will also be able to help them to obtain the right ingredients. In ancient times, royals and aristocrats hired a team of chefs."
